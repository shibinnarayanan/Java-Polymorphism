If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as 
method overriding in Java.

Usage of Java Method Overriding
--------------------------------------
1) Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is 
   already provided by its superclass.
2) Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism.

Rules for Java Method Overriding
--------------------------------
1) The method must have the same name as in the parent class
2) The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
3) There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).
