Polymorphism
---------------------------
Polymorphism a concept we can perform one action in different ways.
The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms

There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and 
runtime polymorphism. We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and 
method overriding


Runtime Polymorphism(Dynamic Polymorphism) in Java
----------------------------
Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method
is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.

A method is overridden, not the data members, so runtime polymorphism can't be achieved by data members.

Let's first understand the upcasting before Runtime Polymorphism.

Upcasting
---------
If the reference variable of Parent class refers to the object of Child class,
it is known as upcasting

class A{} 
class B extends A{}
A a=new B();//upcasting  


Compiletime Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)
----------------------------------------------------
Polymorphism resolved during complie time is known as compile time polymorphism
Method overloading is the example of compile time polymorphism
