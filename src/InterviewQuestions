Why can we not override static method?
-------------------------------------------------
It is because the static method is bound with class whereas 
instance method is bound with an object. Static belongs to the class area, 
and an instance belongs to the heap area.

Can we override java main method?
---------------------------------------
No, because the main is a static method.

Difference between Method OverLoading and Method Overriding
---------------------------------------------------------

         Method Overloading
1 Method overloading is used to increase the readability of the program
2 Method overloading is performed within class  
3 Method parameters must be different
4 Method overloading is the example of compile time polymorphism
5 Return type can be same or different but parameter should be different

         Method Overriding
1 Method overriding is used to specific implementation of the method that is
  already provided by its super class.
2 Method overriding is occurs in 2 classed which have IS-A (Inheritance) relation.
3 Parameter must be same
4 Method overriding is the example of run time polymorphism
5 Return type must be same or covariant in Method overriding
