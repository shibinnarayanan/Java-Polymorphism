If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known 
as Method Overloading.

Advantage of method overloading
------------------------------------------
Method overloading increases the readability of the program.
(
Suppose you have to perform addition of the given numbers but there can be
any number of arguments, if you write the method such as a(int,int) 
for two parameters, and b(int,int,int) for three parameters then it may be 
difficult for you as well as other programmers to understand the behavior of 
the method because its name differs
)

There are two ways to overload the method in java
--------------------------------------------------------
1) By changing number of arguments
2) By changing the data type
